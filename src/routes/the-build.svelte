		<p class="pb-1">
			These tools were picked for <span class="font-extrabold text-xl">fun</span>, I was mostly just

			<li>Dev experience using a CSR tool in an SSR app.</li>
			<li>Any excuse to try out three.js!</li>

						really care about the scene too much, my priority was making the website - I was a

					I created the SvelteKit App with Tailwind JIT following this great
					<Link
						str="post"
						url="https://levelup.gitconnected.com/how-to-use-svelte-kit-with-tailwind-css-jit-just-in-time-compilation-bc04c0c9ec17"
					/>. From there I installed three.js with it's type definitions.
				</p>
				<p class="max-w-md pb-5">
					Since I want to load a .gltf scene, lets set up GLTFLoader from three.js. This turned out
					to be a little tricky, but I got it working by grabbing the code from the
					<Link
						str="GitHub"
						url="https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/blob/dev/examples/jsm/loaders/GLTFLoader.js"
					/>, and I added it to the src directory of my project as <Code str="GLTFLoader.ts" />. I
					then changed the import in GLTFLoader to be
					<Code str="from 'three'" />. This was a work around for this
					<Link str="error" url="https://github.com/manuelbieh/geolib/issues/208" />. Hopefully this
					gets fixed soon! Now simply import your loader, don't forget to destructure it!
				</p>
				<Code str={"import { GLTFLoader } from '../GLTFLoader'"} />

						Finally, it's time to actually put our scene on the page. To do this we have to remember
						that three.js relies on running client side as it references a canvas in the DOM. The
						canvas is then updated by a self calling function (the animation loop) using <Code
							str="requestAnimationFrame()"
						/> to render it's cool 3D scene to. To find out why we do this, I highly recommend this <Link
							str="talk"
							url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCOL7MC4Pl0"
						/>.

					<p class="pb-5">
						Nothing a simple <Code str="onMount()" /> can't solve! Then for loading your scene, I followed
						this nice <Link

							url="https://redstapler.co/add-3d-model-to-website-threejs/"
						/>.

						The rest is nothing more than fancy <Link
